##Introduction and Objectives
Energy consumption is a critical indicator for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers to develop effective energy policies and solutions for an effective use of electricity and power loss reduction. However, accurately forecasting and analyzing energy consumption data can be challenging to obtain, as most data are preliminary and subject to revision.

In this project, we will use time series analysis in R to forecast and analyze energy consumption data for three sectors: residential, commercial, and industrial, in the United States, from February 1973 to November 2022. Motivated by the importance of accurate and reliable energy consumption data, this project aims to contribute to a better understanding of energy trends and help inform policy and decision-making in the energy sector. By forecasting and analyzing the EIAâ€™s data on residential, commercial, and industrial uses, we hope to shed light on the drivers of energy consumption in these sectors and identify potential opportunities for reducing energy consumption and improving energy efficiency. 

Moreover, in the time range of February 1973 to November 2022, the United States has experienced a number of political and natural disturbances, such as recessions, pandemics, and natural disasters. Those external factors frequently have an impact on electricity consumption. Then this project aims to explore the impacts of external disturbances on energy consumption in each sector. Forecasting the energy consumption could help ensure the reliability of the energy needs in each sector amid the turmoil and further seek the potential use of emerging technologies such as energy storage in the respective sector. 

Objectives
The objective of this study is to analyze: 
  (1) Effective use of electricity in the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors while considering the energy loss data
  (2) How energy consumption gets affected by natural and political disturbances in each sector 
  (3) Potential in the use of energy technologies, such as electricity storage, by the sectors

## Dataset Information
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) is the best source of energy data in the United States. It puts out detailed monthly and annual reports on energy production, consumption, stocks, trade, and the effects of different energy sources on the environment. The dataset on energy consumption by the three sectors of residential, commercial, and industrial, covering the period from February 1973 to November 2022, has been selected for analysis for the purposes of this study. This data set has five metrics for each sector, including total energy consumption, end-use energy consumption, energy losses in the electrical system, and primary energy consumption. In order to better understand the patterns of electricity use and energy efficiency in the three sectors, our study focuses on two variables: primary energy consumption and energy losses. Most energy sources, including coal, natural gas, petroleum, geothermal, solar, and biomass, are included in primary energy consumption.
Overall, the following steps were applied to our dataset:
  (1) Download the dataset from EIA.
  (2) Import the dataset to R and delete the unit column.
  (3) Keep two variables for three sectors.
  (4) Convert the dataset from characters to numerical.
  (5) Round all numbers to three decimal places.
  (6) Create a date's data frame.
  (7) Convert the original dataset into time series data for forecasting and summarize it.
  (8) Calculate the mean, standard deviation, maximum values, minimum values, and ranges for primary energy consumption and electrical losses in three sectors.
  (9) Make a summary statistics table.
  (10) Utilize ggplot() to compare three sectors using two initial plots that are variable-classified.

The industrial sector has the highest average consumption (1806.54 trillion BTU) when comparing primary electrical consumption across the three sectors (Table 1). Despite the similar average energy losses across all three sectors, the residential sector nevertheless suffers from the highest energy losses as a result of overcoming transmission line resistance.
The residential sector has the highest primary electricity consumption, whereas the industrial sector has the lowest energy losses, according to a comparison of standard deviations that we also conducted.
The ranges show the fundamental seasonal shifts over the last few decades. For primary electricity consumption, the residential sector has the strongest seasonality, while the industrial sector exhibits the least seasonality.

The highest primary energy consumption in Figure 1 is in the industrial sector. Although there is the most seasonality in the residential sector, the commercial sector uses the least primary energy. Strong seasonality is typically more pronounced in the residential and industrial sectors in the summer and winter but less pronounced in the spring and fall. In general, residential and commercial sector patterns are nearly stable; however, exogenous influences throughout time cause the industrial sector to experience increasing and declining trends.
In contrast to the commercial and residential sectors in Figure 2, the electrical losses in the industrial sectors are decreasing. In three sectors, electricity losses are highest in the residential sector while being lowest in the industrial sector. Three industries saw an increasing tendency in energy losses prior to 2000, but after that year, they saw decreasing trends.

We initially build three sub-data frames containing the two variables primary electricity consumption and energy losses for each of the three sectors. All data were converted to time series data. To compute five one seasonality models, forecast consumption and losses from 2017 to 2022, and determine the most effective forecasting models for the next 10 years, all three sectors also contain one testing dataset and one training dataset between 1973 and 2017.

Before running a time series forecast model and selecting models for time series forecasting, we examine ACF and PACF plots of the original, un-transformed time series (shown below).
```{r echo=FALSE}
#ACF and PACF plots for primary energy consumption
par(mfrow=c(1,6))
ACF_Plot1 <- Acf(electricity_consumption_R$Primary.Energy, lag = 30, plot = TRUE,main="Residential ACF")
PACF_Plot1 <- Pacf(electricity_consumption_R$Primary.Energy, lag = 30, plot = TRUE,main="Residential PACF")
ACF_Plot2 <- Acf(electricity_consumption_C$Primary.Energy, lag = 30, plot = TRUE,main="Commercial ACF")
PACF_Plot2 <- Pacf(electricity_consumption_C$Primary.Energy, lag = 30, plot = TRUE,main="Commercial PACF")
ACF_Plot3 <- Acf(electricity_consumption_I$Primary.Energy, lag = 30, plot = TRUE,main="Industrial ACF")
PACF_Plot3 <- Pacf(electricity_consumption_I$Primary.Energy, lag = 30, plot = TRUE,main="Industrial PACF")

```
For our first variable--primary energy consumption, both ACF and PACF not only show strong seasonality but also non-stationary due to slow decays.
```{r echo=FALSE}
#ACF and PACF plots for energy losses

par(mfrow=c(1,6))
ACF_Plot1 <- Acf(electricity_consumption_R$Energy.Losses, lag = 30, plot = TRUE,main="Residential ACF")
PACF_Plot1 <- Pacf(electricity_consumption_R$Energy.Losses, lag = 30, plot = TRUE,main="Residential PACF")
ACF_Plot2 <- Acf(electricity_consumption_C$Energy.Losses, lag = 30, plot = TRUE,main="Commercial ACF")
PACF_Plot2 <- Pacf(electricity_consumption_C$Energy.Losses, lag = 30, plot = TRUE,main="Commercial PACF")
ACF_Plot3 <- Acf(electricity_consumption_I$Energy.Losses, lag = 30, plot = TRUE,main="Industrial ACF")
PACF_Plot3 <- Pacf(electricity_consumption_I$Energy.Losses, lag = 30, plot = TRUE,main="Industrial PACF")
```
For our second variable--energy loss, both ACF and PACF still show significant values beyond thresholds, especially at lags=12 and 24.
